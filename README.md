# Speech-Emotion-Recognition-
Speech emotion Analyzer using CNN

This project is incomplete as of now due to errors in importing tensorflow in jupyter notebook and jupyter is not able to import keras library.
While executing import keras the kernel dies and file gets crashed.

I have also tried my code on with VSCode, pycharm, google colab(currently working with this)

Due to multiple crashes and system issues: 
I have divided the files into two segmants.

Data exploration/visualisation & Feature extraction where waveform and spectoform care formed using histograms and subplots.
librosa library was used for audio files analysis by extracting pitch, magnitude and signals using MFCC.

I am currently working issues and will take on building and tuning model using CNN for predicting emotions out audio files.
